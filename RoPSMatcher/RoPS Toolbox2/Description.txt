RoPS toolbox

* The toolbox is used to extract RoPS features on point-clouds or meshes.

* Input: a point-clouds or mesh with a set of keypoints
* Output: The Local Reference Frame (LRF) and Rotational projection statistics (RoPS) feature at each keypoint.

* The toolbox provides a function to construct a Local Reference Frame (LRF) at each keypoint. The LRF is robust to noise and varying resolution. It is also unique and unambiguous.

* The toolbox provides a function to extract the RoPS feature at each keypoint. RoPS is generated by rotationally projecting the neighboring points of a keypoint onto three coordinate planes and encoding the rich information of the point distribution into a set of statistics. RoPS is highly discriminative and robust to a number of
nuisances including noise, varying resolution, rotation, translation, holes and topology changes.
